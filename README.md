# JS_Error_Handling
## Objective

In this exercise, we will be practicing error handling in JavaScript by implementing **selective catching**, **strict mode** and `try/catch/finally` blocks.
### Exercise 1: Enable Strict Mode

Complete the following in your `app.js` file

1. Enable JavaScript's "Strict Mode" for the _file_

### Exercise 2: Function Syntax Debugging

Complete the following in your `app.js` file

1. There is a problem with the function syntax. Fix the issue before you finish.

> HINT: The issue will cause `data` to be read as `null`.

### Exercise 3: Using Try/Catch

Complete the following in your `app.js` file

1. Add a try/catch block in the function body
2. Try to return the data parsed to JSON
3. Catch any raised exceptions
4. If an exception is caught:
   1. Print the error to the console
   2. Return null

### On Complete

When you are finished, your console should resemble the following:

```txt
null
{ success: true }
```
